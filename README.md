# Fire Game & Watch Remake

A modern remake of the classic Game & Watch Fire game for the Playdate console.

## Features

- Physics-based gameplay with dynamic bounce mechanics
- Edge-based bouncing system for strategic play
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Classic black and white aesthetic
- Crank-based controls
- High score tracking

## Gameplay

Help rescue victims from a burning building:
1. Use the crank to move firefighters left and right
2. Catch falling victims with the trampoline
3. Bounce them toward the ambulance
4. Score increases with each successful rescue
5. Game ends when you lose all lives

### Controls
- **Crank**: Move firefighters left/right
- **A Button**: Start game / Menu selection
- **B Button**: Pause/Resume game

### Mechanics
- Edge hits provide stronger horizontal momentum
- Minimum bounce velocity ensures ambulance reach
- Progressive difficulty (second victim at 500 points)
- Immediate victim respawn after rescue/loss

## Development

- Playdate SDK
- Lua development environment
- VSCode (recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Playdate SDK
3. Open in VSCode
4. Build and run using Playdate simulator
