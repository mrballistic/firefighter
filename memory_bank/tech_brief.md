Here's a technical brief for the Playdate "Fire" remake:

# Technical Brief: Game & Watch "Fire" Remake for Playdate

## Project Overview
A modern remake of Nintendo's classic Game & Watch "Fire" game, adapted specifically for the Playdate handheld gaming system, utilizing its unique crank control mechanism.

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Target
- Device: Playdate
- Screen: 400x240 1-bit display
- Primary Control: Crank mechanism
- Secondary Controls: D-pad, A/B buttons (optional use)

### Development Environment
- Language: Lua
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Platform: macOS
- SDK: Playdate SDK
- Required Extensions: Playdate VSCode extension, Lua language support

## Core Game Components

### 1. Static Elements
- Building (left side)
- Ambulance (right side)
- Ground/base level
- Score display
- Lives indicator

### 2. Dynamic Elements
- Firefighters with trampoline (crank-controlled)
- Jumping victims (automated)
- Bounce physics
- Score particles/effects

### 3. Game Mechanics

#### Movement System
- Primary Control: Crank
- Movement Range: Limited between building and ambulance
- Movement Type: Linear horizontal translation
- Precision Required: Pixel-perfect positioning

#### Victim Generation
- Spawn Point: Random windows in building
- Spawn Rate: Gradually increasing
- Movement Pattern: Parabolic jump trajectory
- Physics: Simple gravity simulation

#### Collision System
- Trampoline bounces
- Ground impact detection
- Ambulance safe zone detection
- Building collision boundaries

### 4. Scoring System
- Points per save
- Combo system for consecutive saves
- High score tracking
- Local score storage

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Physics Implementation
- Gravity simulation
- Bounce mechanics
- Collision detection optimization

### 2. Crank Control
- Smooth movement translation
- Position boundaries
- Acceleration/deceleration

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Sprite management
- Collision detection optimization
- Frame rate consistency

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics
- Basic movement system
- Simple collision detection
- Primitive graphics

### Phase 2: Game Logic
- Scoring system
- Victim spawning
- Basic physics

### Phase 3: Polish

- Memory management
- Bug fixing

## Required Resources

### Graphics
- Building sprite (with windows)
- Firefighter sprites
- Victim sprites (multiple animations)
- Ambulance sprite
- UI elements

### Audio
- Bounce sound effects
- Scoring sounds
- Game over sound
- Background music (optional)
