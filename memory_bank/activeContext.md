# Active Context: Fire Game & Watch Remake

## Current Focus
Core gameplay implementation and visual refinement. Establishing proper game layout and version control.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented core game loop with physics and collisions
- Adjusted game layout for better visibility
  - Building positioned at y=160
  - Firefighters and ambulance at y=220
  - Score display clearly visible at top
- Updated visual style
  - White sprites on black background
  - Black windows on white building
  - Black cross on white ambulance
- Added .gitignore for proper version control

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. Using Entity Component System for game objects
2. Implementing Observer pattern for game events
3. Using Command pattern for input handling
4. Organizing code into modular components

### Technical Decisions
1. Targeting 30 FPS minimum for smooth gameplay
2. Optimizing collision detection for performance
3. Implementing sprite batching for efficient rendering
4. Using memory pooling for dynamic objects

## Current Considerations

### Implementation Priorities
1. Sound effects for gameplay events
2. Additional visual polish
3. Difficulty progression
4. High score persistence
5. Performance optimization

### Technical Challenges
1. Balancing game difficulty
2. Smooth animation transitions
3. Sound effect timing
4. Memory usage optimization
5. Save state implementation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add sound effects for:
   - Victim bouncing
   - Successful rescue
   - Game over
2. Implement difficulty progression
3. Add high score persistence
4. Polish animations
5. Add particle effects

### Upcoming Work
1. Create proper game assets
2. Add particle effects
3. Implement difficulty progression
4. Add high score persistence
5. Comprehensive testing

## Open Questions
1. Best approach for difficulty scaling
2. Animation state management
3. Sound effect prioritization
4. Performance optimization strategies

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. Frame rate drops with many victims
2. Memory usage with particle effects
3. Sound latency issues
4. Battery drain from physics calculations

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Early performance testing
2. Memory usage monitoring
3. Input system optimization
4. Efficient resource management
